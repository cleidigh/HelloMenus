Hey all

Perhaps this has a simple answer because I'm missing 
something stupid. If not then I guess it's my question 
for tomorrow unless someone has the quick answer.

I can't get windows.create() to create a window that 
is responsive to the content. This occurs creating 
a window with either no body dimensions or with 
min-height/width set on body.

Example - should create window sized to content, but instead 
creates a large window about 80% width of screen and 90%
height. Should be "natural size" according to docs.

  await browser.windows.create({url: "/minimalwindow.html", type: "popup"});

html:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	<title>Export html</title>
</head>

<body>
	<div>test bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb</div>
</body>

</html>
